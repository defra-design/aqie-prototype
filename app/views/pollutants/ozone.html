Ozone is not emitted directly from any human- made source. It arises from chemical reactions between various air pollutants, primarily [NOX](/pollutants/oxides-of-nitrogen) and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), initiated by strong sunlight.

Formation can take place over several hours or days and may have arisen from emissions many hundreds, or even thousands of kilometres away.

## Effects on health and the environment

Exposure to high concentrations may cause irritation to eyes and nose. Very high levels can damage airways leading to inflammatory reactions.

Ozone reduces lung function and increases incidence of respiratory symptoms, respiratory hospital admissions and mortality.

Ground level ozone can also cause damage to many plant species leading to loss of yield and quality of crops, damage to forests and impacts on biodiversity.
