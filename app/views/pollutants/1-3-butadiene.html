Mainly from combustion of petrol. Motor vehicles and other machinery are the dominant sources, but it is also emitted from some processes, such as production of synthetic rubber for tyres.

## Effects on health and the environment

1,3-butadiene is also a recognised genotoxic human carcinogen, as such, no absolutely safe level can be specified in ambient air.

The health effect of most concern is the induction of cancer of the lymphoid system and bloodâ€“forming tissues, lymphoma and leukaemia.
