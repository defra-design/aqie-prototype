Mainly derived from agriculture, primarily livestock manure/slurry management and fertilisers. Small proportion derived from variety of sources including transport and waste disposal.

## Effects on health and the environment

Ammonia can lead to damage of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems through deposition of eutrophying pollutants and through acidifying pollutants.

Precursor to secondary particulate matter and therefore contributes to the ill-health effects caused by [PM10 and PM2.5](/pollutants/particulate-matter).
