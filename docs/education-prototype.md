Findings from the first round of user research with [the initial prototype](/initial-prototype) found that:

* participants expected to see government providing this content and considered GOV.UK to be a trusted source of information,
* showing typically low values in the air quality forecast (which itself covers a large area) sometimes didn’t correlate with a participant’s own experience, undermining any initial trustworthiness,
* users were keen to know more; what air quality means for them and their family and what practical actions they could take,
* participants didn’t think in terms of local/regional/national; they started with their own area of interest and moved on to other areas from there,
* the option to get local information drew attention away from any other content on the homepage, including links to guidance.

If we consider each prototype iteration to have a particular theme, the initial prototype focused on **presentation**, collating and providing structure around existing data sources.

Leading with an air-quality forecast – backed up with information about particular pollutants – proved problematic as this information lacked context.

For this iteration we focused on **education**, combining user’s interest in their local area with editorialised and localised content about air quality.

## Spheres of influence

Air quality is influenced by varying factors at different levels. Consider the following:

* **for an individual**, existing health conditions can be agrevated by increased levels of air pollution. Age and your daily activities may also be factors in the degree air quality is an issue.
* **in the home**, poor ventilation and indoor pollutants such as mould or mildew may be a factor.
* **on the street**, your proximity to busy roads, nearby industrial polluters and localised activity like wood burning can be factors.
* **within a neighbourhood**, prevailing weather conditions dictate the level of air pollution, and the type of area (urban, suburban or rural) can dictate which pollutants are more common.
* **within a local authority area**, interventions that have been implemented or are being considered will have an impact.
* finally, **regional and national** policy decisions will dictate the overall strategy for improving air quality.

## Design

We started with a page of guidance driven by the above model:

However, this was a lot of information to show on one page. Might it be possible to split the information up into sections?

We arrived at a direction where the story of air quality in a particular area could be told:

* A description of the sources of pollution (with content shown dictated by the type of area shown) that could provide context for information shown on later pages,
* The measured air quality right now, and what it the forecast over the next 5 days,
* If the given postcode is in a smoke control area,
* How air pollution is being monitored and managed by the local authority,
* How the local authority is trying to improve air quality
* What has been the outcome of these interventions.
